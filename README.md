## Introduction

UrlAutoRedirector is a chrome extension that enables you to skip certain pages, mostly useless referral/ad pages, after you click on affiliate links.
By doing so, it gets you directly to your destination page.

## Usage

## Installation

UrlAutoRedirector will be published to Chrome WebStore with a stable version.

Currently, I have difficulty in activating Google developer account in China.

Thus, you have to try it in Chrome Developer Mode. :smile:
